Something that can be improved:
1. Establish Routes.js file and let it perform it as indicator for each file at one place.
- Home.js can be the place to let it happen. (Create Routes.js prior to implement it on here!)

Some major things to do:
1. Use object base and establish properties with key and value. (for wiki.js)
2. may use array (for Navbar.js)
