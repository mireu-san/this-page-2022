        1. Why I choose to be developer? 2. Am I sustainable? (will to keep
        learning the stuff?) 3. Why I choose to do only JS base language? (to be
        specialised on it, rather than jack of all trades) 4. React targets to
        conquer UI for web client side. 5. Typescript is very reliable language
        especially when I do coding myself alone. So, personally I prefer using
        Typescript. 6. There is concern that react is not enough to grow further
        than where I am. I prefer using TS and JS for now.
